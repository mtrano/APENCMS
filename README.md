## APENCMS
  APENCMS was intended to be the smallest, easiest and simplest flat-file no-frills CMS in PHP.
  I have discontinued working on this project. v0.9 is the last version I released in 2009.
  You can obtain the lastest community version here - APENcms.co.uk!

  Personally I feel v0.9 is the last release which adheres to the initial design goal of being the Smallest CMS.
  Happy browsing.

## Quick Feature List
 * Single page templates. Takes 2 minutes to add a new theme.

3. Change permissions to the following files / folder to make them writable: `config.php`, `db.dat`, `/files`.

Default installation user/pass pair is :
