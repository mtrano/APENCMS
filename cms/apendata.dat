With an active class on the current element ( `class=\"active\"` )\r\n- `$_CMS['prev_page']` full url friendly link to the previous page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.\r\n- `$_CMS['next_page']` full url friendly link to the next page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.\r\n- `$_CMS['is_404']` : Boolean returning if the page is a 404 not found file.\r\n\r\n#### Adding extra variables\r\n\r\nOn the `config.php` file, you can add more `'key' => 'value'` items to the returned array so you can access to them later on the main template.
